                <h1>Hello dear user!This website is about USSR's history and intresting facst about it!I hope u will like it! </h1>
                <p>What should we start with?Of course with how Soviets appeared!Soviet Union was formed in 1922 as the result of the October revoulition in 1917.
                   Before its happened it was a Russian Empire.I'm pretty sure you are know curious about why do people started this revoulition!So,revoulition
                   started after WW1,when Russian Empire lost it's most valueble territories during this war,and economy crisis happened,and people of course 
                   didnt like it and after while group of some people in Moscow and Petrograd(Saint Petersburg) attacked Russian Empire and started to capture it's
                   land.More and more people wanted to join Soviets and Russian Empire was losing,in 1922 revoulition was fully ended and USSR was formed.USSR's 
                   first ruler was Vladimir Lenin,he was a good ruler but he was ruling only for 2 years beacuse he died.He died because of stroke in 1924.Next
                   ruler were Joseph Stalin,he ruled till his death in 1953,he was rude and strict ruler,but he managed to improve USSR's economy and won WW2 against
                   Geramny in 1941,I personally think that Joseph Stalin is best Soveit's leader.During WW2 Germany was having good relationship with soviets,they even
                   divided Poland together in 1939,but then in 1941 Germany suddenly attacks soviets.Soviets were losing but after some mistakes that Geramny made 
                   Soviet Union was able to make it way to Berlin,while other soviet's allies were attacking from behind.After that,in 1945 Germany surrenders.
                   after what it was divided into 4 parts,and then by 2.One were given to USSR,and other one to USA.In 1949 USA made NATO,a pact againist soviets,then
                   in 1955,USSR made Warsaw pact,a pact against americans.And then cold war started.In 1991 Soviet Union dissolves into 15 independent states.

                About Stalin:Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin[f] (born Dzhugashvili;[g] 18 December [O.S. 6 December] 1878 – 5 March 1953) was a Soviet politician and revolutionary who 
                    was the longest-serving leader of the Soviet Union from 1924 until his death in 1953. He held power as General Secretary of the Communist Party from 1922 to 1952, 
                    and Chairman of the Council of Ministers (head of government) from 1941 until his death. Initially governing the country as part of a collective leadership, Stalin 
                    consolidated his power within the party and state to become a dictator by the 1930s. Ideologically, he formalised his Leninist interpretation of Marxism as 
                    Marxism–Leninism, while the totalitarian political system which he established is known as Stalinism.
